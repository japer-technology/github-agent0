# Agent Zero Design Theories → .GITCLAW Adaptation

This folder contains a two-part examination of how Agent Zero's architectural design theories can be adapted for the .GITCLAW governance framework.

## Contents

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [ANALYSIS.md](./ANALYSIS.md) | Deep theoretical analysis of Agent Zero's 7 core design theories, with evaluation of each theory's applicability to .GITCLAW |
| [REPORT.md](./REPORT.md) | Actionable adaptation recommendations — proposed architecture, directory structures, workflows, risk matrix, and implementation priorities |

## Key Findings

**7 design theories identified in Agent Zero:**
1. Prompt-driven behavioral architecture
2. Hierarchical multi-agent delegation
3. Memory-augmented learning
4. Tool-as-code synthesis
5. Extensibility-first modularity
6. Containerized environment isolation
7. Skill-based contextual expertise (SKILL.md)

**5 recommended adaptations for .GITCLAW:**
1. Policy-as-prompt templates (`.gitclaw/policies/`)
2. Parallel governance agent hierarchy
3. Precedent memory system (vector-store backed)
4. Semantic policy activation (POLICY.md standard)
5. Containerized evaluation sandboxes

**3 theories requiring caution or rejection:**
- Unrestricted code synthesis → sandboxed only
- Behavioral self-modification → prohibited in governance
- Single-chain hierarchy → replaced with consensus model

## Reading Order

Start with **ANALYSIS.md** for the theoretical foundation, then proceed to **REPORT.md** for the practical architecture.
